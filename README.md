# CoreFunctions

Repository containing common functions(plotting etc etc) in bioinformatics - most of them are wrappers build upon existing packages - The ultimate goal is to have a standard function behaviour for associated projects. Will write more about it later. 
#To do: create documentation, test cases, attach with Semaphore/Travisci, create a dependency list and so on.
